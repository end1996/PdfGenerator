Rabbit is SO excited to go fishing with Bear. But Bear's not feeling up to it. . . . He's feeling low, like his pocket is full of sads that are weighing him down. Although Bear doesn't know why he's feeling this way, Rabbit is sure she can fix it! Rabbit looks to the internet for advice, but none of the self-help tips seem to help. The friends try meditating, healthy eating, even a new hobby, only to learn that when it comes to having the sads, there's no easy fix--except, maybe, friendship. This tender picture book is the perfect primer to help children understand the heavy-hearted sadness that can come out of nowhere. And more importantly, it helps kids and adults be better listeners and more supportive companions to friends dealing with tough feelings. A must have for homes and classrooms alike!",
